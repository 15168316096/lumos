# Lumos Works with UniSat

Nervos maintains a powerful lock
called [Omni Lock](https://github.com/XuJiandong/docs-bank/blob/master/omni_lock.md) (previously named RC lock), which
can use MetaMask as a signer. This example will show how to use Lumos to send a transaction using Omni lock and MetaMask

## Quick Start

> we should [build](..) Lumos project first before we start this example

```
npm run build
cd examples/omni-lock-
npm start
```
